<div class="d"><h3 id="taj mahal">TAJ MAHAL</h3><p>This magnificent work of art is situated in Agra on the Yamuna River’s southern bank. Constructed by the Mughal ruler, Shah Jahan, as a tribute to his spouse, Mumtaz Mahal, this architectural marvel is a masterpiece. An estimated ₹32 million was spent on building the facility, which employed about 20,000 craftspeople. Because it is “the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage,” the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. This enormous tomb is a timeless symbol of love and an entire empire’s creative and scientific achievements. It ought to be among the historical sites you must see.

Standing at an imposing 72.5 m high, the view of Delhi city from the top is impressive. It is an excellent masterpiece of Mughal architecture, ranging from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m at its base, with its alternating angular and rounded flutings.</p><br><br><a href="1.html">Read more</a></div>

Widely known for the outer walls which stretch to a distance of almost 2 kilometers, the fort is named as such as it was built from red sandstone which gives the building a red tint. Constructed way back in the 17 centuries by the emperor Shah Jahan, this structure was the center of his Mughal administration as he moved his capital from Agra to Delhi. With an architectural style which is a combination of Mughal and Persian, the structure has got a number of museums, the majestic palace and a beautiful garden in addition to many other amenities. It has got quite a lot of gates with the Lahore gate being the most prominent one as it is the place ahead of which the national flag is raised during each Independence Day celebrations by the Prime Minister before his speech.</P><br><br><a href="1.html">Read more</a></div>

Red sandstone and white marble structures dating back to fourteenth century can be found in various parts of India. Timurid dynasty contributed to many radially symmetrical buildings — tombs and palaces — in many parts of Iran and Central Asia. However, there are no precedents that can be found that accounts that all these elements existed in a single monument, until the construction of Humayun’s tomb. Documented as the first ever tomb built for a Mughal emperor, this is the structure that is considered to be an inspiration for the most well known example of Mughal architecture, the Taj Mahal.

        The significance of Humayun’s tomb goes way beyond just being a prototype for the Taj Mahal. This tomb was the first structure in which the slightly bulbous and double dome, a feature borrowed from Persia and Samarkand, was introduced in India. It is also the first example of a tomb set within a cross-axial garden in India. Its enormous scale and radially symmetrical plan makes the building stand out as one of the greatest examples of the Mughal royal mausoleum building style.</P>

It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.

        The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.</P><br><br><a href="1.html">Read more</a></div>

It is also shaped like a crown as the ruler who built it, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. This magnificent attraction is one of the popular tourist places in Jaipur and is among the India’s famous buildings due to its curved architecture.
